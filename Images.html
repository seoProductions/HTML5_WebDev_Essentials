    <h3 id="img">The image tag <<i>img</i>> </h3>
    <p>the <b>img</b> tag is an empty tag. It only has attributes. Let's take a look at some</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>src</b>: the relative URL of the image file
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>alt</b>: detailed description of the image. (used by search engines and screen readers )
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>title</b>: Displayed when image is hovered
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p> here is a random photo I found lying around my desktop</p>

    <img src="images/Placeholder.png" alt="Picture of a dinosaur giving you a side-eye" title="Dino">

    <h3 id="sizing">Its good practice to add size specifications to images</h3>
    <p> this helps the browser load faster by knowing where to place the text, without needing the image to load! </p>
    <p> you only need 2 attributes for this: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>height</b> (in pixels)
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>width</b> (in pixels)
        </li>
    </ul>
    <!-- My IDE automatically tells me the image dimensions -->
    <img src="images/Placeholder.png" alt="Picture of a dinosaur giving you a side-eye" title="Dino"
        height="140" width="300">

    <p> When you have an <b>img</b> tag inside a paragraph, you can align the image. Use the align attribute </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>align</b> left or right of the screen
        </li>
    </ul>
    <hr>
    <p><img src="images/Placeholder.png" alt="Picture of a dinosaur giving you a side-eye" title="Dino"
            height="140" width="300" align="right">
        Here is an example. This random photo I found is aligned to the right,
        and the text is free to fill in the gaps.
    </p>
    <p><img src="images/Placeholder.png" alt="Picture of a dinosaur giving you a side-eye" title="Dino"
            height="140" width="300" align="left"> Here is an example. This random photo I found is aligned to the left,
            and the text is free to fill in the gaps.

    <p>You can see its qutie buggy with HTML5.</p>

    <h3 id="figure">HTML5: Figure and Figcaption</h3>
    <p> Figure is a container which holds both <b>img</b> and <b>figcaption</b>.
        This makes it possible to associate an image with its caption. There was no way of doing this prior to HTML5</p>
    <figure>
        <img src="images/Placeholder.png" alt="Picture of a dinosaur giving you a side-eye" title="Dino"
             height="240" width="400">
        <figcaption>
            Place holder photo of a dinosaur
        </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>I like this way better than align. Figure can have multiple images: each sharing the same caption</p>

    <figure>
        <img src="images/Placeholder.png"
             alt="Picture of a dinosaur giving you a side-eye"
             title="Dino"
             height="50" width="50">
        <img src="images/Placeholder.png"
             alt="Picture of a dinosaur giving you a side-eye"
             title="Dino"
             height="50" width="50">
        <img src="images/Placeholder.png"
             alt="Picture of a dinosaur giving you a side-eye"
             title="Dino"
             height="50" width="50">
        <figcaption>
            many photos sharing the same caption
        </figcaption>
    </figure>
